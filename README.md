## Common rules

The Faculty Board of the Faculty of Science and Engineering (FNT) decided on 21 May 2025 that the doctoral studies within the Doctoral Programme in Chemical and Process Engineering, the Doctoral Programme in Biosciences and Drug Research, and the Doctoral Programme in Sciences and Information Technology will comprise 30 credits and include the following components:

- At least 20 ECTS in the major subject or related fields (such as complementary areas, interdisciplinary connections, etc.) for a 3â€“4-year doctoral project.
- A maximum of 5 ECTS for participation in conferences (5 ECTS requires active participation with one's contribution in at least two international conferences).
